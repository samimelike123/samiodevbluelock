<p>Isagi is a second-year high school student who played as a forward for the Ichinan High School football team. When he arrived at the Blue Lock facility, he became a member of Team Z for the First Selection. His main goal is to become the world's best striker.

    After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20, Isagi is ranked as one of the top players in Blue Lock and plays as a forward on Germany's Bastard München during the Neo Egoist League.
    
    Unlike his fellow competitors, who were handpicked by Anri Teieri after watching them play, Isagi was chosen personally by Jinpachi Ego himself after seeing him play. Isagi is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create.sagi is a teenager of slightly above average height and muscular build, developing a stronger, more defined-looking physique. He has short, dark blue hair that leaves a V-shaped fringe between his deep blue eyes.

    While attending Ichinan High School, he wore an unbuttoned blazer over a white undershirt and striped tie. Both the Ichinan High jersey and gym uniform are light-colored with black stripes.
    
    At Blue Lock, Isagi wears the standard-issued body suit (black with blue stripes) and tracksuit. During the First Selection, he wore Team Z's blue #11 jersey and Team Z's gray-capped cleats. During Second Selection, he wore Team White's #15 jersey and later switched to red. He then later switched to Team A's black #15 jersey during the Blue Lock Eleven tryouts. lsagi dons an official blue-colored Blue Lock player uniform with the #11, that looks very similar to the ones seen in the first cover spread minus the Japan flag during the Japan U-20 match. As a regular for Team Germany, Isagi wears the red and black with gold stripes Bastard München uniform as #11.Isagi is easygoing and has a generally friendly, cheery personality, but his simple and innocent habits often get on the nerves of the people around him. He tends to avoid any childish squabbles among other Blue Lock competitors and tries to be a peacekeeper between his friends and rivals. At the beginning of Blue Lock, Isagi is massively unsure of himself and his skill due to being the second-lowest-ranked player in Blue Lock initially and his conflicting ideas of football. As time goes on, Isagi develops a more assertive presence on and off the field, becoming the foundation for Team Z and garnering the respect of some of the best players in Blue Lock, who mostly have heavily assertive or dominant personalities. As of Third Selection, Isagi has the confidence, charisma, and reputation to talk openly with Rin Itoshi, one of the most talented yet difficult people in the Blue Lock Project.

    Initially, Isagi was unsure on how to proceed in Blue Lock due to being taught an ideology during his time in high school that conflicted with what was being promoted in Blue Lock, as well as being unsure on how to be egotistic. However, starting with Team Z's first win and subsequent wins thereafter, Isagi becomes well-acquainted with the rush of victory, and the cold ruthlessness needed to survive in Blue Lock. As times goes on, he becomes willing to step on the plans and dreams of his opponents and teammates in order to score a goal and go further in Blue Lock. When it comes to football, he is ambitious and calculated, willing to change and adapt, to get the right "chemical reactions" out of his teammates, to stay a step ahead of their opponents, and be the best player on the field, staying true to his commitment to becoming the world's best striker. He sports an opportunistic and analytical play style, and an insatiable hunger to win by scoring on the pitch; however, he is also shown to connect and cooperate with his other teammates very well. Importantly, Isagi has often valued and recognized the strengths of others' play, but as he proceeds through Blue Lock, he is able to identify and harness his own strengths to score.
    
    Ever since meeting and losing to Rin, Isagi has been chasing him, attempting to surpass him at every turn. He goes out of his way to get closer to Rin, attempting to copy his cooldown routines and adapting his mindset, in an attempt to get closer to his level. Isagi believes that when he is able to truly surpass Rin, he will be closer than ever to his goal of becoming the best striker in the world. Isagi is still prone to being nervous before big matches such as: During the end of First Selection, the beginning of Third Selection or the Japan U-20 match and was slightly nervous whilst being interviewed after his decisive goal. However, in each case Isagi was able to fully realize his ego, and confidently stake his place among the best in Blue Lock, declaring that he would lead the Japan U-20 to victory in the World Cup. Isagi now doesn't like when someone believes that his achievements are just out of luck and not because of his skills as a player and striker, when he meets Tada, an old teammate from his school, and comments how "lucky" he was to score that goal in the match against Japan U-20, Isagi feels dismayed since Tada had absolutely no idea how much he had to fight every day inside of Blue Lock to get in the position he is currently, yet it does not dismay him for long as it motivates him into returning to Blue Lock and evolving even more.
    
    After the beginning of the Neo Egoist League, Isagi's ego is much more noticeable than before, feeling completely insulted when Yukimiya questioned his decision making a pass called him someone with a small way of thinking. The conversation enraged Isagi and provoked him to the point of almost getting into a fight with Yukimiya inside of the dressing room. He is also entirely capable of showing frustration when things doesn't go like he planned, in the Bastard München vs Manshine City match he is frustrated and enraged when his strategy to score a goal was taken away by Kunigami who took the opportunity and stole Isagi's clear opportunity and even more when Kaiser makes fun of him saying that he likes making passes to goal instead of making them himself, not caring anymore about showing his egoism. According to Noel Noa, Isagi has an almost identical perspective on football as Ego, as they both share a mutual obsessive desire to win, he has even begun to exhibit a similar devilish smile on his face like Ego's, whenever he's pumped up. During the final match against Paris X Gen, after learning that Noa has been using him as a stepping stone for Kaiser from the very beginning, Isagi discovered an unfamiliar level of rage and frustration within him, his mindset became solely focused into destroying his former idol and everyone else who see him as a stepping stone.</p>
