        When first arriving at Blue Lock, Nagi was a member of Team V and was the best player in his designated stratum. After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 team, Nagi was ranked as one of the top players in the project.Nagi is a tall young man with a lean but muscular build. He is shown to have medium length white hair that leaves a V-shaped fringe in between his eyes. He has gray-colored eyes with large irises.

        Back in high school, Nagi wore a school uniform consisting of a white blazer with a cascading star pattern on the collar, though he wore a dark hoodie under it instead of a dress shirt and tie. He wore the dress pants and dress shoes as well.
        
        At Blue Lock, Nagi wears the standard-issued body suit (black with gray stripes) and tracksuit. During First Selection, he wore Team V's #11 jersey, and during Second Selection, he wore Team White's #7</p>
