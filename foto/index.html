    <p>Michael Kaiser (ミヒャエル・カイザー Mihyaeru Kaizā?) is a prodigy U-20 forward from Germany who plays for Bastard München during the Neo Egoist League as the team's ace and main striker. Kaiser is regarded as a genius and is also a member of the New Generation World XI.Kaiser is a tall young man with blue eyes and blonde hair, accented by red eyeliner. His hairstyle includes a mullet with blue streaks at the ends and two deep blue rat-tails. He symbolizes blue rose tattoos on his neck, which transition into chain-like intertwined thorny stems down his left arm, culminating in a crown with a keyhole on his left hand. He is typically seen wearing his Bastard München #10 uniform, which features red and black with gold stripes, complemented by black and gold striped socks, sneakers, and a long-sleeved shirt.Kaiser is shown as an arrogant young man who has a superiority complex. He sees everybody around him as merely small time actor compared to his big time main role as the star of his world. Though he is arrogant and slyly rude to people he sees as beneath him, he is not unnecessarily rude to his teammates but will put them in their place when they unnecessarily speak out even if it's for his sake. Even though Kaiser is arrogant and rude, he knows when to control himself around people who are definitively better and superior to him, such as his team leader and the best striker in the world, Noel Noa.

      After the match against the Ubers, Kaiser was immensely frustrated when he lost to Isagi a second time. Originally, he joined Bastard Munchen because it was the quickest way to get into Re Al, but now he cannot just leave the Neo Egoist League after losing to Isagi.
      
      Kaiser believes that the moment people believe things are impossible, they are programmed to give up. Those who sacrifice their talent in exchange for living long and tedious lives are the ones he hates the most.
      
      Before, Kaiser was a mentally weak person who constantly gave up on things he believed to be impossible. To remind himself to never again too fall into that weak mindset, he got a blue rose tattoo on his neck, which he believes symbolizes the achievement of the impossible.</p>
