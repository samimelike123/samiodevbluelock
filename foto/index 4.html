<p>Reo Mikage (御み影かげ 玲れ王お Mikage Reo?) is a contender for the Blue Lock Project, who currently plays as a center midfielder for England's Manshine City during the Neo Egoist League.
    Reo is the heir of the Mikage Corporation, with his total assets valued at about 705.8 billion yen or $5.3 billion USD. Prior to entering Blue Lock, he was a student at an elite high school, where he met his first long-term friend, Seishiro Nagi, who started playing soccer shortly after him due to Nagi's natural talent in the sport, and Reo's craving to go further in football. Being a young man who has almost everything at the tips of his fingers thanks to his father being the head of the Mikage Corporation, his one and only desire is to win the Football World Cup.
    
    When he first arrived at Blue Lock, Reo was a member of Team V and arguably the second-best player in his designated stratum. He played as a center-back for the Blue Lock Eleven against the Japan U-20.Reo is a tall young man with a lean build. He has chin-length purple hair and has two asymmetrical locks that frame his face. He has big, bright purple eyes.

    At Blue Lock, Reo wears the standard-issued body suit (black with blue stripes) and tracksuit. During the First Selection, he wore Team V's blue #9 jersey and Team V's gray-capped cleats. During Second Selection, he wore Team Red's #10 jersey, which later switched to white. During Third Selection, he wore Team C's white and blue #10 jersey. During the match against the Japan U-20, Reo dons an official, blue-colored Blue Lock player uniform with the #14.</p>
