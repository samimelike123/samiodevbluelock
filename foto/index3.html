<p>Rin Itoshi (糸いと師し 凛りん Itoshi Rin?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist League.
    Rin is the younger brother of Sae Itoshi, who started playing football with him at a young age. He has played as a forward on every team he was on and has always been regarded as one of the top players. He is regarded as Blue Lock's best player until he is officially confirmed to be by Jinpachi Ego at the beginning of the Third Selection.[11]
    
    Rin's main goal is to become the world's best striker. He used to be fixated on defeating his brother in football and in turn, getting revenge for abandoning their shared dream, but after the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 he let go of his revenge and decided to change so that he may become the world's best striker, defeating anybody in his path. Rin is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create.Rin is a tall teenager with a slim but muscular build. He is noticeably taller than Yoichi Isagi who is 5 months older than him. He has black hair with a bang going across his face more in his right eye than left eye, slim teal eyes, and distinct eyelashes that he shares with his brother Sae Itoshi. As a young boy, Rin looks largely the same, his facial features just become more distinct as he gets older.

    At Blue Lock, Rin wears the standard issued body suit (black with gray stripes) and tracksuit. During Second Selection, he wore Team Red's #1 jersey and wore Team A's #1 black jersey during the Third Selection. Only once the Japan U-20 match begins does he don an official blue Blue Lock player uniform with the jersey #10 and a captain's armband.As a young boy, Rin was very innocent and in awe of his brother, Sae, wanting nothing more than to become a cool and strong player like him. He started playing football because his brother told him to, following his orders without question. As they played football together, Rin listened to whatever Sae said and adjusted accordingly. When Sae left for Spain, Rin found football was more difficult without his brother but strived to become just like him and replace him. This is where Rin's core style of play would begin to shift from his instinctive style to a more logical style.

    Initially, he was a good team player and captain for his middle school team, appearing to be on good terms with some of his teammates. However, due to his fallout with his brother, he has become cold, blunt, and overly serious. He is entirely focused on soccer, to an almost obsessive degree and is also very egoistic, as he is always putting his goals first over everybody and their motivations. Rin has a lot of pride as a striker, which borders on arrogance, since he frequently describes other people's soccer and way of thinking as "lukewarm" or "mediocre". These mannerisms and behaviors came from his brother; in an attempt to be like his brother, Rin copies his words and embodies his mindset.</p>
