        <P> (千ち切ぎり 豹ひょう馬ま Chigiri Hyōma?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a left wing for England's Manshine City during the Neo Egoist League.
            Chigiri is a forward prodigy who was chained down by a leg injury in his past but he let go of his fears while at Blue Lock so he could continue playing football wholeheartedly. When first arriving at Blue Lock, Chigiri was a member of Team Z. Chigiri spent half of the First Selection avoiding participation or keeping it to a bare minimum but when he was motivated by Isagi in Team Z's third game, he decided to let go of his fear and play football to become the world's best striker like his rivals.Chigiri is a young man with reddish pink hair and deep pink eyes. Chigiri has always had a very feminine face since he was young, as shown by his long eyelashes and soft facial features. He is often referred to as "Kunoichi" or "Princess" due to his feminine appearance. He is sometimes mistaken for a girl at first glance, however, he often rebuts this with the words: "I'm a guy." He has been praised by other players for being attractive, though he seems indifferent to such comments. He looks very similar to his mother and older sister. Chigiri's hair had been only neck length until he tore the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) in his right leg, after which he let it grow out. Chigiri's hair currently goes past his shoulders and has one long bang that sweeps to the right side of his face. During games, he braids the left side of his hair so that it doesn't get in his face.

            At Blue Lock, Chigiri wears the standard-issued body suit (black with gray stripes) and tracksuit. During the First Selection, he wore Team Z's blue #4 jersey and wears Team Z's gray-capped cleats. During Second Selection, he wore Team Red's #44 jersey and that later switched to white when Chigiri joined Isagi's team. During the Third Selection, he wears Team B's #44 white jersey. It is not until the match against the Japan U-20 does Chigiri don an official blue and black Blue Lock player uniform with the #4 on it.
            
            He wears jersey #44 for Manshine City. When playing for Manshine City, he wears the short-sleeved uniform top, shorts, socks and a pair of black gloves.</P>
